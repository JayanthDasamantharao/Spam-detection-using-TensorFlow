# Spam detection using TensorFlow

In this project, we'll delve into the development of multiple deep learning models using TensorFlow to tackle SMS spam detection. The primary objective is to assess and compare the performance metrics of these various models.

To achieve this, we'll work with the SMS Spam Detection Dataset. This dataset encompasses SMS text samples along with their corresponding labels, distinguishing between "Ham" (legitimate) and "Spam" messages.
